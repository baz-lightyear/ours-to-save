                <h4>How we store it</h4>
                <p>Ours to Save maintains commercially-reasonable technical, administrative, and physical security measures designed to protect your information from loss, misuse, unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. When your credit or debit card account information is being transmitted to or through our services, it will be protected by cryptographic protocols. To be clear, Ours to Save does not itself store your credit or debit card account information, and we do not have direct control over or responsibility for your credit or debit card account information. We use third party payment processors that are the controllers of your credit card information. Our contracts with third parties that receive your credit or debit card account information require them to keep it secure and confidential.</p>
                <p>You play an important role in keeping your information secure. You should not share your user name, password, or other security information for your Ours to Save account with anyone. If we receive instructions using your user name and password, we will assume you have authorized the instructions. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with us is no longer secure (for example, if you feel that the security of any account you might have with us has been compromised), please contact us immediately.</p>
                <p>We may retain your personal information for as long as your account is active and for a period of time afterwards to allow you to re-activate your account without loss of information. We may also retain your personal information as necessary to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Maintain logs and business records for analysis, security, and/or audit purposes.</li>

                    <li>Comply with our legal obligations, protect or defend our rights, resolve disputes and enforce our contracts.</li>
                </ul>
