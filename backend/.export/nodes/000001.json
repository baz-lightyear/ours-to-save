You may have seen images of Elijah and his energetic accomplices in the media over the last couple of years. For this 16-year-old climate activist, who has been actively involved in the UK’s school strikes for climate since he was 14, magazine shoots and world travel have become the norm.

Apart from a few friendly regular commuters, Elijah was largely ignored. He got a “a bit of press – not loads, just an average amount I guess” and politicians looked the other way as they passed the 16-year-old sitting on his own with his handmade sign explaining what he was doing. \"}]},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/bazkingdon/image/upload/v1588079274/EPyGcPEWkAAsQnd_1_y89adv.jpg\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Ultimately, Elijah didn’t get the response he was looking for, but tells me with an infectious optimism that he still has plans in the works. Not another hunger strike, he quickly reassures me. In fact, he vocalises the complexities of his own activism with no prompt. He doesn’t think we should be living in a world where 16-year-olds are going on hunger strikes, sitting out in the cold before school. But he was feeling desperate, it was a “cry for help – hardly any activists were even speaking about this mine. I felt like I couldn’t do any more.”\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"It wasn’t a stunt, aiming to create a ripple effect, he explains. “It wasn’t an action to try and revolutionise activism – I didn’t want to change anything about youth activists or what they do because I don’t think it’s appropriate for youth to be doing hunger strikes – because it’s not a thing they should be doing at all, it’s not a thing anyone should resort to.” \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Try to put Elijah and his fellow young activists in a box as ‘keyboard warriors’ and you’re not paying attention. He has doubts about whether going on hunger strike is the right thing to do, but he did it because his philosophy is that you have to show up - in person, sometimes at places of power, sometimes with hundreds of thousands of others.  \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Of course, the traction from the activism this generation performs is largely generated online; after you’ve showed up, your protest lives a new life in Twitter retweets, Instagram likes and Reddit threads. It’s a process Elijah is still learning how to harness effectively. He reflects on how his focus has been on Instagram – where most of his peers are, and where his posts contribute to the movement of young people who are fighting for climate justice. \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"“But,” he continues, “I think I didn’t realise how to gain traction with politicians, because the world is on Twitter – journalists are on Twitter, politicians are on Twitter. It’s important to realise where your target audience is.” \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"This brings us to the new focus of our conversation. How does the youth climate movement cope now that the fundamental tenet of their activism - showing up in person - is the one thing they cannot do?

He reasons maturely and forcefully that the current crisis needs to take total priority for now. \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"He’s also exhausted. He needed a breather – and it couldn’t come unless it was forced by one of the few emergencies that should take immediate priority. In the last year he has led a remarkable life, catching the Eurostar to the European Parliament with Greta Thunberg and visiting the Amazon to meet with the famed Brazilian leader and environmentalist Chief Raoni. He takes huge pride in having made so many connections across the globe. However, just as it was when he described balancing a hunger strike with school commitments, his age is abundantly clear as he observes that “in the Amazon there were lots of scary things, and I felt really sad hearing loads of stuff. There are lots of security risks – people try to threaten you online and you have to take it seriously. People have hacked into my accounts recently.”\"}]},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/bazkingdon/image/upload/v1588079276/ES-moIrXsAA1OFv_1_ot8mdw.jpg\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"The complexities of teenagers shouldering the weight of the biggest crisis that will face our generation are deep. Elijah does not fall on one side or the other. “The youth had no choice but to take this burden on. The youth had to take urgent action, and lead this action – because no one else is. Do youth want to take this action is a different question. In some ways it is very empowering – we are the future of the planet. However, to make real change we need intergenerational unity.” \"}]},{\"type\":\"block-quote\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"“It’s made me feel much more passionately that we will solve the climate crisis, because it shows that we can. We still have time.”\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"I push a bit further into Elijah’s break from activism, and it becomes clear that it is not exactly a rest. He has a group chat on Telegram with 400 other activists from all around the globe. They have moved to digital striking every Friday instead of sitting outside places of power – posting a picture of themselves online with their placards, all using the same hashtags. They are also holding webinars every week with inspirational activists around the world, to really get an insight into what people are doing and how to create change. This time now is for them to share their experiences and gain an overview of what works and what doesn’t, so that they can go back to the drawing board with a stronger understanding of what will make a difference. \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"This period of reflection is incredibly necessary because Elijah and his peers are well aware that as we emerge from the current crisis, we will have the opportunity to take real action on the looming climate crisis. “Post covid-19,” Elijah explains, “is the only time in history we will have the opportunity to rebuild our economy to benefit us completely.” A Green New Deal has long been a part of the activists’ demands, with a socially justified period of transition. It hasn’t escaped anyone’s attention that covid-19 cuts across borders, and that collaborating within and between communities has been key to tackling it. All of us have had to take on individual responsibility. Elijah has taken new hope from this. “It’s made me feel much more passionately that we will solve the climate crisis, because it shows that we can.
