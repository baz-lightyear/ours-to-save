For this 16-year-old climate activist, who has been actively involved in the UK’s school strikes for climate since he was 14, magazine shoots and world travel have become the norm.

He got a “a bit of press – not loads, just an average amount I guess” and politicians looked the other way as they passed the 16-year-old sitting on his own with his handmade sign explaining what he was doing. \"}]},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/bazkingdon/image/upload/v1588079274/EPyGcPEWkAAsQnd_1_y89adv.jpg\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Ultimately, Elijah didn’t get the response he was looking for, but tells me with an infectious optimism that he still has plans in the works.

He doesn’t think we should be living in a world where 16-year-olds are going on hunger strikes, sitting out in the cold before school. But he was feeling desperate, it was a “cry for help – hardly any activists were even speaking about this mine. I felt like I couldn’t do any more.”\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"It wasn’t a stunt, aiming to create a ripple effect, he explains. “It wasn’t an action to try and revolutionise activism – I didn’t want to change anything about youth activists or what they do because I don’t think it’s appropriate for youth to be doing hunger strikes – because it’s not a thing they should be doing at all, it’s not a thing anyone should resort to.” \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"Try to put Elijah and his fellow young activists in a box as ‘keyboard warriors’ and you’re not paying attention.

He takes huge pride in having made so many connections across the globe. However, just as it was when he described balancing a hunger strike with school commitments, his age is abundantly clear as he observes that “in the Amazon there were lots of scary things, and I felt really sad hearing loads of stuff. There are lots of security risks – people try to threaten you online and you have to take it seriously. People have hacked into my accounts recently.”\"}]},{\"type\":\"image\",\"url\":\"https://res.cloudinary.com/bazkingdon/image/upload/v1588079276/ES-moIrXsAA1OFv_1_ot8mdw.jpg\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"\"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"The complexities of teenagers shouldering the weight of the biggest crisis that will face our generation are deep.

Do youth want to take this action is a different question. In some ways it is very empowering – we are the future of the planet. However, to make real change we need intergenerational unity.” \"}]},{\"type\":\"block-quote\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"“It’s made me feel much more passionately that we will solve the climate crisis, because it shows that we can.

He has a group chat on Telegram with 400 other activists from all around the globe. They have moved to digital striking every Friday instead of sitting outside places of power – posting a picture of themselves online with their placards, all using the same hashtags. They are also holding webinars every week with inspirational activists around the world, to really get an insight into what people are doing and how to create change. This time now is for them to share their experiences and gain an overview of what works and what doesn’t, so that they can go back to the drawing board with a stronger understanding of what will make a difference. \"}]},{\"type\":\"paragraph\",\"children\":[{\"text\":\"This period of reflection is incredibly necessary because Elijah and his peers are well aware that as we emerge from the current crisis, we will have the opportunity to take real action on the looming climate crisis. “Post covid-19,” Elijah explains, “is the only time in history we will have the opportunity to rebuild our economy to benefit us completely.” A Green New Deal has long been a part of the activists’ demands, with a socially justified period of transition. It hasn’t escaped anyone’s attention that covid-19 cuts across borders, and that collaborating within and between communities has been key to tackling it. All of us have had to take on individual responsibility. Elijah has taken new hope from this. “It’s made me feel much more passionately that we will solve the climate crisis, because it shows that we can.
