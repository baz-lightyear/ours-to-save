The regenerative nature of floods helps replenish water bodies and maintain th landscape, a mix of wetlands, grasslands and semi-evergreen deciduous forests. The floodwaters also function as a breeding ground for fish. In a herbivore-dominated area like Kaziranga, it is important to maintain its grassland status.
